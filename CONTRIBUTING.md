# Contributing to wpdev

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to wpdev! We value the input and efforts of our developer community. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your contributions are greatly appreciated.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository. This creates your own copy of the project where you can make changes.

2. **Create a Branch**: For each new feature or fix, create a new branch in your forked repository. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the change you're making.

3. **Develop Your Contribution**:
    - **Code Contributions**: If you're adding or changing functionality, please ensure your code adheres to the existing coding style. Use 4 spaces for indentation and omit semicolons in JavaScript.
    - **Documentation**: If you're improving documentation, ensure clarity and conciseness. Update the README.md if necessary.

4. **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting your changes, thoroughly test to ensure your contribution doesn't introduce bugs or break existing functionality.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Each commit should represent a logical unit of change.

6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Push your branch to your fork and then open a pull request to the original repository. In the PR description, explain your changes and link to any relevant issues.

7. **Code Review**: Once your PR is submitted, it will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make revisions if requested.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Respect the Code of Conduct**: We have a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to adhere to. It outlines our expectations regarding behavior and cooperation.
