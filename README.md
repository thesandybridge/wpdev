## Overview

wpdev an integrated solution for managing WordPress environments. It consists of three core components:

1. üñ•Ô∏è Frontend WebApp Dashboard: A HTMX and Actix-web dashboard for a user-friendly interface to manage WordPress environments.
2. üîß Backend API: Developed using Rust with Rocket and Bollard, this API handles the setup and management of WordPress, Nginx, Adminer, and MySQL Docker containers within an instance.
3. ‚å®Ô∏è CLI Tool: An alternative to the Frontend WebApp, providing command-line access to the same functionalities.

## Getting Started üåü

2. Build the CLI tool:

```bash
cargo build --bin wpdev_cli --release
```

3. Link the binary for easy access:

```bash
ln -s target/release/wpdev_cli /usr/local/bin/wpdev
```

## Usage üíª

### Frontend WebApp

- Access the WebApp through http://localhost:8080.
- Manage WordPress environments through the user-friendly dashboard.

### Backend API

- The API runs on http://localhost:8000.
- Use the API endpoints to create, manage, and delete WordPress environments.

### CLI Tool

- Run wpdev --help for a list of commands and usage instructions.
- Perform similar operations as the WebApp through command-line instructions.

## Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

The roadmap outlines the planned improvements and major features that are in the pipeline for wpdev. This list is subject to change and will be updated as the project evolves.

- [x] Rebuild Frontend with Actix-web/HTMX: Transition the current Next.js-based frontend to Actix-web/HTMX to enhance performance and maintainability.
- [x] Add logging and more config customization.
- [ ] Add logging to the webapp UI and implement health checks for each
instance.
- [ ] Add options for updating the instance.toml from the webapp, including an
option to generate the instance.toml via an interactive form.
- [ ] Build a cleaner UI that is more feature rich and user friendly with theme
  options, plugin management, and more.
- [ ] Add support for changing PHP and MySQL versions as well managing WordPress
  updates directly from the webapp.
- [ ] Create documenation and Wiki for wpdev.

Please note that this roadmap is indicative and might evolve based on the project's progress, community feedback, and contributor availability.
